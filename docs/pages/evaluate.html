      <h3 class="h3 1">Testing Results</h3>
      <p>
        The initial unit testing results confused us. We failed the first test
        becuase the driver had no garage, but chose third party. We treated the
        calculation as normal even though not having a garage should not affect
        the third party premium.
      </p>

      <p>
        We fixed this problem by ammending our Package class with an if
        statement that check if the package is not "third party" before add the
        garage increase.

      <p>
        We have since added two additional tests to increase the scope of the
        unit testing. Our program is currently passing all 5 tests. However, the
        unit tests will be useful if we further develope the program in the
        future as they will fail if we make a logic error, thus helping us
        eliminate all errors that python does not catch.

      <h3 class="h3 1">What parts worked out as expected?</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to our prudent planning most of this project worked out as
        planned. The inputs and outputs all worked as intended, we had no issues
        there. Implementing the Package class worked well, it also helped cut
        down on unit test code. The unit tests worked as intended, by helping us
        identify small logical errors that would have went uncaught otherwise.
        The Python interpreter can only catch syntax errors and fatal logic
        errors.

      <h3 class="h3 1">What parts did not work out as expected?</h3>
      <p>
        Like with all programming projects we faced problems. The first problem
        we faced was extremely high quotes. Our program was outputting quotes of
        €5000 for a car worth only €4000. This was caused by compounding, every
        time we increased the quote we multiplied the same variable causing the
        value to compound. We fixed this by implementing a rate_accumulator
        array. Each quote increase is appended to this list and at the end the
        get_quote function returns the sum of the quote_accumulator, using the
        Python sum() function.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">What were our biggest challenges?</h3>
      <p>
        Our biggest challenge was using the csv to store our unit test values.
        We could not get this to work properly for two classes as we were trying
        to use our own functions. After further research we found that Python
        has a built in csv module to help deal with these problems, thus
        allowing us to cut down on code length and complexity.

      <br />
      <p>
        Another challenge we faced was keeping the quotes realistic. We had to
        adjust the percentages multiple times to make it as accurate as
        possible, however it is still not perfect. For example if your car is
        expensive and you chose third party fire and theft or fully
        comprehensive your quote may be off because we always add 5% of the car
        value to the accumulator. This doesnt affect cars worth less than
        €25000, but it is noticable if your car is worth more than this. We
        could find any inofrmation on how real world companies take value into
        account this, this was the best solution that we found.
