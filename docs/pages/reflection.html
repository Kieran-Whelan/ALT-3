      <h3 class="h3 1">Overall Project</h3>
      <p>
        In the end our project worked as intended. We certainly had some issues
        along the way such as graphing the headings incorrectly. Time management
        was an issue for us, we strive to improve our time management skills in
        future projects. On the other hand, using github to track and save our
        progress worked extremely well. It kept all of our resources in one
        place and enabled us to collaborate effectively. If we had more time we
        would definitely expand and enhance the Python code by adding features
        such as a dynamic year range selector and more choice in types of graph
        for example only 1st quarters or exclude clothing. In addition to this
        if we had more time we could have hosted our docs on github pages.

      <h3 class="h3 1">Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Our goal was to investigate if the quarter of a year affected consumer
        spending. We investigated this by plotting of line graph of all three
        categories and a graph of the median values for each quarter. We found
        out that Q3 is the peak time for hotels and restaurants, Q4 is the peek
        time for Food, Clothing and Footwear and Q4 in general is the peak time
        period for consumer spending each year. Lastly, consumers spend the
        least amount of money in Q1. The min value for all full(1997 - 2017)
        graphs was 1997 Q1 and the max was 2017 Q4 this is inline with UK
        inflation trends over the last 20 years.
