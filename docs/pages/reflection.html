      <p>
        In the end our project worked as intended. We certainly had some issues
        along the way such as the CSV code and finding appropriate percentages
        to calculate the quote. We stuck to our
        <a class="link" onclick="goto_page(1)">Planned Timeline</a> finishing
        most of the project before Thursday the 26th and just adding finishing
        touches on Friday the 27th. Using github to save our progress and
        resources worked extremely well. It kept all of our resources in one
        place and enabled us to collaborate effectively. If we had more time we
        would definitely expand and enhance the Python code by adding features
        such as more region options i.e rates for each county or possibly an
        Eircode reader that determines which region you live in and adjusts your
        quote accordingly. In addition to this if we had more time we could have
        hosted our docs on github pages. Ultimately this project helped us
        expand our knowledge of modelling and understand the real-world
        applications of models. Furthermore, we learned about the value of unit
        testing. We had never worked with unit tests before, but this project
        demonstrated to us why they are invaluable in real world programming.
