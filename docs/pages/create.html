      <p>
        In order to code this model we followed the these sequential steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Step 1 - We researched insurance websites and lay out a list of variables to take into account</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 2 - We then created a basic version in Python</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 3 - We optimized the basic Python version by implementing Object Orientated Programming in pseudo code</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 4 - We implemented OOP into our python program and adjusted the percentages to give more realistic outputs</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 5 - We then created unit tests and expected values to ensure no programming errors</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 6 - We then implemented these tests and created a csv containing all the test data</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 7 - Finally we ran manual tests and with the goal of crashing the program, we only crashed it once but fixed it with an error check in the Package class</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">How it works?</h3>
      <p>
        When our program is ran it runs all unit test cases to ensure code is
        working. The results of these tests are printed in the terminal. Then
        the program asks the user for the input variables. These variables are
        used to create a package class which in turn calculates the quote. The
        quote is then outputted to the user assuming the user inputs all
        information correctly.

        <h4>Main Function</h4>
        <p>
          The main function is ran when the program starts. Firstly, it runs the
          unit test cases.

      <div>
        <h4>Package Class</h4>
        <p>
          We had to create our own median function as we needed the find the sum
          of the median of three values to be plotted on the median graph. This
          was something that we could not achieve using pandas alone. This short
          function finds the sum of medians across our three datasets row by
          row.

          This is a standard main function that is called when the script is
          run. This code takes in user input and displays the selected graph.
