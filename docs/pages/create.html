      <h3 class="h3 1">Programming Process</h3>
      <p>In order to code this model we followed the these sequential steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 1 - We researched insurance websites and lay out a list of
            variables to take into account
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 2 - We then created a basic version in Python</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 3 - We optimized the basic Python version by implementing
            Object Orientated Programming in pseudo code
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 4 - We implemented OOP into our python program and adjusted the
            percentages to give more realistic outputs
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 5 - We then created unit tests and expected values to ensure no
            programming errors
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 6 - We then implemented these tests and created a csv
            containing all the test data
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Step 7 - Finally we ran manual tests and with the goal of crashing
            the program, we only crashed it once but fixed it with an error
            check in the Package class
          </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">How it works?</h3>
      <p>
        When our program is ran it runs all unit test cases to ensure code is
        working. The results of these tests are printed in the terminal. Then
        the program asks the user for the input variables. If the variables are
        not needed to calculate the quote for a specific package those variables
        are skipped. These variables are used to create a package class which in
        turn calculates the quote. The quote is then outputted to the user
        assuming the user inputs all information correctly.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h4>Main Function</h4>
        <p>
          The main function is ran when the program starts. Firstly, it runs the
          unit test cases. Then it asks the user for all input variables
          required to calculate the quote. It passes these variables into the
          Package constructor, which calculates the quote. The quote is then
          returned and outputted to the user.
        </p>
        <img class="code" src="/docs/images/code/Main.png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Package Class</h4>
        <p>
          The Package class takes in all variables and calculates the quote
          using the rate_accumulator array. This array is appended with the
          increase for every variable. The final quote is gotten from the sum()
          of this array.
        </p>

        <img class="code" src="/docs/images/code/ClassBottom.png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Rate Dictionaries</h4>
        <p>
          The rate dictionaries contain the multiple choice rates that are used
          to calculate the quote. The key is the option the user selects which
          is a integer input and the value is the float percentage value.
        </p>
        <img class="code" src="/docs/images/code/Dictionaries.png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Unit Test Function</h4>
        <p>
          The unit test function loads all unit test data from the data.csv file
          using the python "csv" library. The function runs each row in the file
          as a test, comparing the actual value from the Package class to the
          expected value that we calculated on paper.
        </p>
        <img class="code" src="/docs/images/code/UnitTest.png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Covert List To Int Function</h4>
        <p>
          This function goes through every item in a list and tries to convert
          them to a integer. If it receives the ValueError, this means it's not
          an integer, subsequently it skips it and repeats till every item is
          checked. It's needed to pass in the values into the program, since the
          program won't work if u need an integer and it's a string instead.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">Unit Test Table</h3>
      <p>
        We ran the following unit test on our program using the run_unit_tests
        function seen above. We calculated the expected values on pen and paper
        to ensure the program is working as intended.
