      <p>
        Firstly our program allows the user to choose the graph range and type
        of graph that they wish to view in the terminal. We take the input using
        the standard Python input() function. We have 3 range options: full 1997
        - 2017, first half 1997 - 2006 and second half 2007 - 2017. These
        options can be applied to the median or separate categories graph.

        <h4>Main Function</h4>
        <p>
          This function has three parameters. (data) is the raw csv passed in.
          (heading) is the csv heading of the column containing the data values.
          (graph_range) is the range of rows to be displayed on the graph. The
          if statement selects the data range to be used based on the user
          input. The rest of the function parses the data for use.

        <h4>Package Class</h4>
        <p>
          We had to create our own median function as we needed the find the sum
          of the median of three values to be plotted on the median graph. This
          was something that we could not achieve using pandas alone. This short
          function finds the sum of medians across our three datasets row by
          row.

        <p>
          This is a standard main function that is called when the script is
          run. This code takes in user input and displays the selected graph.
