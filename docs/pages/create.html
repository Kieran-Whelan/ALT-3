      <p>
        When our program is ran it run all unit test cases to enusre code is working. The results of these tests are printed in the terminal. Then the program asks the user for the input variables. These variables are used to create a package class which in turn calculates the quote. The quote is then outputted to the user assuming the user inputs all information correctly.

        <h4>Main Function</h4>
        <p>
          The main function is ran when the program starts. Firstly, it rubs the unit test cases.

        <h4>Package Class</h4>

          We had to create our own median function as we needed the find the sum
          of the median of three values to be plotted on the median graph. This
          was something that we could not achieve using pandas alone. This short
          function finds the sum of medians across our three datasets row by
          row.

          This is a standard main function that is called when the script is
          run. This code takes in user input and displays the selected graph.
