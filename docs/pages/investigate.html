      <h3 class="h3 1">What we are modelling?</h3>
      <p>
        We are modelling a car insurance quote model. This will be a python
        program that prompts the user to enter information about their vehicle,
        package, driving experience etc. Our program will not have a
        GUI(Graphical User Interface), it will strictly take input through the
        command line. Upon taking input our program will calculate and output a
        quote to the user based on the variables they entered.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3 3">What research we carried out?</h3>
      <p>
        We looked at different car insurance providers' website to get an idea
        of how much quotes were for different people, depending on the unique
        factors. We compiled all variables we found on these websites into our
        own variable table and then we chose what we wanted to include. We based
        some of our percentages off of research, however we could not access the
        actual rates insurance companies use to calculate premiums. We found
        most of our rates through trial and error, trying to keep the quotes as
        realistic as possible. To ensure the quotes remained realistic, we
        compared our programs output to real life premiums and adjusted our
        figures accordingly.
