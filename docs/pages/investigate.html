      <h3 class="h3 1">What we are modelling?</h3>
      <p>
        We are modelling a car insurance quote model. This will be a python
        program that prompts the user to enter information about their vehicle,
        package, driving experience etc. Our program will not have a
        GUI(Graphical User Interface), it will strictly take input through the
        command line.

      <h3 class="h3 2">Why we chose this project?</h3>
      <p>
        We chose this project as we are both new drivers trying to find a
        reasonable insurance quote. We are also both interested in maths. One of
        us wants to do Actuarial Maths in College, which looks at insurance
        quotes and risk assessment.

      <h3 class="h3 3">What research we carried out?</h3>
      <p>
        We looked at different car insurance providers' website to get an idea
        of how much quotes were for different people, depending on the unique
        factors
