      <p>
        We chose to design a car insurance model for ALT3. We chose this project
        as we are both new drivers trying to find a reasonable insurance quote.
        We are also both interested in maths. One of us wants to do Actuarial
        Maths in College, which looks at insurance quotes and risk assessment.
        We decided against the Dijkstra's algorithm model as a GUI would be
        needed for this, the command line would not suffice. We decided against
        the compound interest model as we had already done this in class and
        wanted to challenge ourselves. The car insurance model was the perfect
        balance, it would be challenging, but not have too many variable like
        the Inflation basket and Electricity Metre models.
