      <h3 class="h3 1">Outline Plan</h3>
      <p>
        After we trim our csv files using excel. We plan to use the python
        pandas library to parse and clean the csv data. Then we will use the
        matplotlib.pyplot library to draw appropriate graphs using the data. We
        plan to create three separate graphs showing all quarters for all years
        comparing our three chosen categories. This graph can be used to analyse
        any category for any period by utilizing pyplot's zoom function. We also
        intend to create a graph of the average value of all categories for each
        quarter. Our selected categories of Clothing and Footwear, Food and
        non-alcoholic beverages and Hotels and Restaurants are broad enough for
        this to be an accurate average of all spending.

      <h3 class="h3 1">Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        We faced a number of challenges while planning this project. The hardest
        part of the planning phase of this project was deciding on what dataset
        to anaylse.
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> contains a large
        variety of datasets, it is overwhelming if you don't know exactly what
        you are looking for. Deciding on team roles was another challenge as we
        both wanted to do the Python, however as a group of two this would not
        be efficent so we ended up flipping a coin to decide.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">Feasibility</h3>
      <p>
        In order to ensure that our project was feasible we had to chose 3
        categories from our dataset of 21 categories. We chose to anaylse: Food
        and non-alcoholic beverages, Clothing and Footwear and Restaurants and
        Hotels. Analysing this whole dataset would not be possible in the time
        allocated as each of the 21 categories also contains subcategories - the
        raw data can be found in the data/raw folder of the project directory.
