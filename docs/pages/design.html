      <h3 class="h3 1">Problem Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        In order to complete this model we followed the these sequential steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Step 1 - We researched insurance websites and lay out a list of variables to take into account</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 2 - We then assigned appropriate percentage weightings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Step 3 - We then created unit tests and expected values to ensure no programming errors</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">Code Design</h3>
      <p>
        We used Python 3 to analyse the code the model. We chose snake_case as
        our variable and function naming convention throughout this project and
        Pascal case for out class naming convention. We decided to employ a
        combination of functional and object orientated programming, we decided
        to use an object oriented approach as it was practical for implementing
        unit tests. We used the Python built-in "math" and "csv" libraries, thus
        cutting down on code length.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="h3 1">Types of graphs</h3>
      <p>
        We decided to go with line graphs as we thought it would display our
        data appropriately. The line graph allows us to easily identify spikes
        and dips in consumer spending. Furthermore, line graphs allow us to
        display 80 quarters in total spanning across 20 years on one graph.
        Something that is difficult to achieve on a bar graphs or pie chart for
        example.
