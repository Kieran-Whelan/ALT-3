      <p>
        We employed exploratory data analysis techniques to identify trends
        visually. Furthermore, we used basic statistics to determine the min,
        max, modal and median values. This was easy thanks to the pandas built
        in functions. We had to code our own median function due to the nature
        of our data and graph. We chose to use median to find the average value
        for each quarter as unlike mean it is not skewed by outliers which makes
        it a more accurate measure of average. Frequency is not relevant in a
        dataset such as this due to the nature of the data, we do not expect any
        values to occur more than once.

      <h3 class="h3 1">Code Design</h3>
      <p>
        We used Python 3 to analyse the data. We chose snake_case as our
        variable and function naming convention throughout this project. We
        employed standard functional programming, we decided against an object
        oriented approach as it was not practical for an project of this scale.
        This project does not have custom datatypes or constructors that require
        this. This is because most of the heavy lifting is done by the panda
        library and matlib.pyplot library.

      <h3 class="h3 1">Types of graphs</h3>
      <p>
        We decided to go with line graphs as we thought it would display our
        data appropriately. The line graph allows us to easily identify spikes
        and dips in consumer spending. Furthermore, line graphs allow us to
        display 80 quarters in total spanning across 20 years on one graph.
        Something that is difficult to achieve on a bar graphs or pie chart for
        example.
