      <h3 class="h3 1">Background</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset that we chose is a UK Consumer Dataset from the years 1997 -
        2022. This is a large dataset so we had narrow down what areas of the
        data we sought to analyse. We decided to only anaylse the data between
        the years 1997 and 2017 as we believed that 20 years was a sufficient
        sample period of time. Another reason fro omitting the years from 2018 -
        2022 was the COVID-19 pandemic that shock the global economy,
        subsequently affecting the consumer spending. Our dataset contains the
        total spending in the UK across all households. The figures are measured
        in millions. It is comprised by the UK Office for National Statistics
        and updated yearly.

      <h3 class="h3 2">Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>
        Using our chosen dataset, we aim to investigate how time of year affects
        consumer spending across different categories. We aim to investigate 3
        categories in total. As a by-product of our investigation we should be
        able to observe a steady rise in spending since 1997. This rise can be
        attributed to many factors with the main one being inflation. The rate
        of inflation in the UK has been 2.75% since the 1980s our values should
        be in line with this.

      <h3 class="h3 3">Research</h3>
      <p>
        We utilized <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">kaggle</a> to
        peruse a vast range of datasets until we found ours. We looked at many
        datasets including: Chicago Crime Stats, Student SAT scores and 2016
        election exit polls. We landed on our Consumer dataset in the end as we
        believed that it contained a sufficient amount of data to anaylse
        multiple areas of the topic. An attribute which the others lacked.
        Futhermore, we believed that analysing this topic provided more value
        and posed more of a challenge than the others.
